 * $Date:        5. February 2013
 * $Revision:    V1.02
 *
 * Project:      CMSIS-RTOS API
 * Title:        cmsis_os.c
 *
 * Version 0.02
 *    Initial Proposal Phase
 * Version 0.03
 *    osKernelStart added, optional feature: main started as thread
 *    osSemaphores have standard behavior
 *    osTimerCreate does not start the timer, added osTimerStart
 *    osThreadPass is renamed to osThreadYield
 * Version 1.01
 *    Support for C++ interface
 *     - const attribute removed from the osXxxxDef_t typedef's
 *     - const attribute added to the osXxxxDef macros
 *    Added: osTimerDelete, osMutexDelete, osSemaphoreDelete
 *    Added: osKernelInitialize
 * Version 1.02
 *    Control functions for short timeouts in microsecond resolution:
 *    Added: osKernelSysTick, osKernelSysTickFrequency, osKernelSysTickMicroSec
 *    Removed: osSignalGet
